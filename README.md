# DGAmodule

This project starts as my Bachelor's Thesis for the Telecommunications Engineering degree. DGAmodule is a software system that implements a layer of detection for domains generated through the "Domain Generation Algorithm" technique. This detection is based on machine learning using two different learning models (no-deep learning and deep learning). The software sets up a functional system that allows for the detection and blocking of DNS requests for domains generated by DGAs without interrupting the normal resolution of non-malicious domains.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone --branch TFG https://github.com/victormatcal/DNS-DGA-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd DNS-DGA-detection`
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Download the sav model from [the following link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qOZuLfLk3imxBa-UM8mpxWqjoHNFhIXe/view?usp=sharing) and place it on the directory `DGAmodule/classifiers/algorithms/RandomForest/models/`

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd DNS-DGA-detection`
2. Run the project: `sudo python3 frontEnd.py`

Now you can make DNS requests to your localhost at port 53:
